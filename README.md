This package contains various modules with functions I (Nikko Cleri) use for my astronomical research. 
This package is broken down as follows: 

spectrum_tools: contains modules to display annotations and highlights of lines on spectra. 
Also includes some rudimentary stacking methods. 

physics_functions: contains various derivations of physical quantities (e.g., star formation rate, luminosity, etc.)
as well as some useful unit conversions (air to vacuum wavelengths, photon energy to wavelength, etc.)

stat_functions: contains uncertainty propagations

figure_functions: contains wrappers to make some of the prominent figures in my work (e.g., line ratio diagnostics)

ratio_diagnostics: contains the functional forms of many emission-line ratio diagnostics of star formation/active black holes

cloudy_utilities: contains functions designed to make outputs from the photoionization modeling code Cloudy more user friendly

miscellaneous_functions: contains other miscellaneous utilities - will likely change significantly over time
